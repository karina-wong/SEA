<!-- Explained enhancements -->
 <!--
• Created a manager registration page with server side validation requiring unique
username and a password rule, and store this information in a table.

• Controlled access to manage.php by checking username and password.
admin_login.php & checks validation so if someone went to it via code it still wouldn't work

• Created a manage job listings section in manage.php where an admin can add new job listings and delete existing ones, 
this automatically updates on jobs.php and apply.php
