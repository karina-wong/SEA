<!-- Explain your enhancements here -->
 <!--
* Provided the manager with the ability to select the field on which to sort the order in
which the EOI records are displayed.


• Created a manager registration page with server side validation requiring unique
username and a password rule, and store this information in a table.
DONE

• Controlled access to manage.php by checking username and password.
DONE -> admin_login.php & checks validation so if someone went to it via code it still wouldn't work
